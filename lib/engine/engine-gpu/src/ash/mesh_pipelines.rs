//! Container for Vulkan graphics pipelines created by the mesh-shader backend.
//! 
//! Currently, this resource holds only a single pipeline (`mesh_pipeline`), but it can be 
//! extended in the future to manage multiple pipeline variants (e.g., for different render passes 
//! or debug pipelines like wireframes).
//! 
//! The `MeshPipelines` resource is `Send + Sync` (just wraps raw handles) and can be stored 
//! in Bevyâ€™s ECS world. We rely on Bevy to automatically drop the Vulkan device (and thus all 
//! pipelines) at app exit, so we do not manually destroy the pipeline here.
//! 
//! # Safety 
//! The stored `vk::Pipeline` must not be used after the Vulkan device is dropped. It remains valid 
//! for the lifetime of the `AshContext`/`RenderDevice`. We do **not** manually destroy it; it will 
//! be cleaned up when the device is dropped by Bevy.

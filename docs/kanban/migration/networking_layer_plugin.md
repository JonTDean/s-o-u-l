    netTodo[To Do]
        net1[Design networking_layer crate structure (separate client and server modules for simulation sync)]
        net2[Decide on networking model (client-server vs P2P) and integrate support accordingly]
        net3[Define protocol for state sync (message schemas for cell updates, user actions, etc.)]
        net4[Implement networking_layer::server::SessionManager (handle multiple clients, send state updates each tick)]
        net5[Implement networking_layer::client::ConnectionManager (connect to server, receive updates, send user inputs)]
        net6[Implement state serialization/deserialization (efficiently serialize grid state and events for network transmission)]
        net7[Ensure simulation determinism or state reconciliation to handle network latency and desync]
        net8[Plan security measures (validate client input, prevent tampering or flooding)]
      
    netProg[In Progress]
        net9[Researching suitable networking libraries (WebRTC vs TCP/UDP frameworks) â€“ **in progress**]

    netRev[Review]
        net10[Review proposed network protocol for completeness and efficiency (team review)]
        net11[Evaluate network layer impact on simulation performance (profiling network overhead)]

    netDone[Done]
        net12[Networking crate scaffolding created (basic module files and placeholders)]
        net13[Preliminary decision on network approach documented (foundation for implementation)]

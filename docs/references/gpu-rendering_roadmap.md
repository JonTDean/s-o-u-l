Great. I’ll structure a roadmap and delivery-phase-oriented kanban board aligned with your GPU rendering engine directory layout.

Each phase—MVP and POC—will include grouped logical tasks across subsystems like core abstractions, pipeline setup, rendering graph, and compute shaders, including documentation and test deliverables.

I’ll get started and let you know once it's ready.


# GPU Rendering Engine Roadmap and Kanban Outline

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP / Proof of Concept

* **Objective:** Establish the fundamental GPU compute pipeline and core infrastructure for the engine. This includes a minimal working example (e.g. Conway’s Game of Life simulation) running on the GPU.
* **Key Tasks:**

  * Set up **core GPU abstraction** (device initialization, buffer and texture creation) for a simple compute shader.
  * Implement a basic **compute pipeline** with a no-op or simple shader (as seen in the stub `automata_compute.wgsl`) and verify it dispatches correctly each frame.
  * Allocate ping-pong **GPU textures** for state storage and ensure the system can write to and read from these textures (using `GpuGridTextures` as designed).
  * Integrate with the **ECS**: add startup systems to allocate resources and a render graph node to dispatch the compute shader each frame (similar to `GpuAutomataUpdateNode`).
  * **Verification:** Create a simple scenario (like a 512×512 Conway’s Game of Life grid) and verify that one step of the simulation is computed correctly on the GPU. Write a basic integration test to compile and run the shader (as in `shader_compile.rs`).

### Phase 2: Full Delivery and Feature Expansion

* **Objective:** Expand the engine to cover all planned modules and features with robust functionality and documentation. This phase delivers a modular, production-ready GPU rendering engine.
* **Key Tasks:**

  * **Rendering Pipeline:** Implement advanced rendering pipelines (e.g. Forward+ and Deferred shading in `pipelines/graphics`). Set up a render graph with multiple passes (lighting, post-process, UI overlay) as outlined in the `renderer/graph` and `renderer/output` modules.
  * **Scene Management:** Develop the scene subsystem (camera, lighting, culling in `renderer/scene`). Ensure that ECS components (meshes, materials, transforms) are in place and that the rendering systems correctly process visible entities each frame.
  * **Compute Features:** Complete the GPU automata features. Finalize Conway’s Game of Life and Lenia continuous CA encoders in `encoder/`, and introduce any additional cellular automata or particle systems in the `pipelines/compute` module (e.g. particle simulation, terrain LOD).
  * **Assets and Shaders:** Build out the asset pipeline. Organize shader code in `assets/shaders` (common includes, material shaders, compute kernels). Create example material shaders and ensure models/textures in `assets/models` and `assets/textures` can be loaded and used in the engine.
  * **Utilities and Optimization:** Integrate profiling and logging tools. Use the `utilities/profiling` module to measure GPU frame times and the `utilities/logging` for debugging. Expose configuration options (feature flags, settings) via the `utilities/config` module to easily toggle features and tuning parameters.
  * **Testing & QA:** Rigorously test all components. Write integration tests for rendering correctness (e.g., image-based regression for frames), stress tests for performance (as in `tests/benchmarks` for frame time and memory), and validation tests (using diagnostic tools or GPU validation layers). Ensure documentation is **dense and comprehensive** for each module (as demonstrated by the doc comments in code), so future developers can understand the system easily.

*(Future phases may include continuous improvement, like adding new graphics techniques or further refactoring, but Phase 2 delivers the core features as per the design.)*

## Kanban Task Breakdown by Module

### Core Infrastructure (GPU Abstraction & Math)

* Implement **Device Manager** and low-level GPU interface (`core/gpu_abstraction/device_manager`): handle device selection, context creation, and resource cleanup.
* Create a **Buffer Pool** or memory allocator (`core/gpu_abstraction/buffer_pool`) to manage GPU buffers efficiently.
* Develop math utilities (`core/math` module): vector/matrix types, geometry helpers, and transformation functions to support camera and object transformations.
* Design data structures (`core/data_structures`): e.g. a spatial hash for object culling, a frame graph or command queue for organizing rendering and compute commands.

### Rendering System (Render Graph & Scene Management)

* Build the **Render Graph scheduler** (`renderer/graph/node_scheduler` and `dependency_resolver`): allow flexible ordering of render passes and compute dispatches.
* Implement **Render Passes** (`renderer/graph/render_passes`): create passes for shadow mapping, geometry rendering, lighting, post-processing, etc., with clear interfaces.
* Set up **Scene components** (`renderer/scene`): integrate a camera system (view/projection matrix setup), lighting system (directional, point lights), and culling logic to filter visible objects each frame.
* Establish **Batching/Instancing** (`renderer/batching`): group draw calls by material or mesh, enable hardware instancing where possible, and prepare an efficient visibility buffer for rendering.
* Develop **Output pipeline** (`renderer/output`): implement tonemapping for HDR rendering, post-process effects (bloom, FXAA, etc.), and an overlay system for UI or debug visuals.

### Pipeline Architecture (Graphics & Compute Pipelines)

* Implement the **Forward+ rendering pipeline** (`pipelines/graphics/forward_plus`): single-pass lighting using clustered shading or similar optimization for many lights.
* Implement the **Deferred rendering pipeline** (`pipelines/graphics/deferred`): G-buffer creation and deferred lighting pass for comparison or heavy scenes.
* Set up a **Raymarch/Raytrace module** (`pipelines/graphics/raymarch`): provide a structure for future advanced techniques (could start with a simple full-screen raymarching effect as a demo).
* Expand **Compute pipelines** (`pipelines/compute`): finalize automata simulation (Conway, Lenia) and add other compute tasks such as GPU particle systems or terrain LOD management. Ensure these can run asynchronously or during appropriate frame phases.
* Define common **Bind Groups** (`pipelines/bindgroups`): set up global uniform buffers (camera matrices, time, etc.), per-material and per-object descriptors for shaders.
* Utilize a **Pipeline Cache** (`pipelines/cache`): reuse compiled pipeline state objects and shader programs, avoiding recompilation each frame. This should interface with the device and possibly hot-reload shaders during development.

### ECS Integration (Components & Systems)

* Create ECS **Components** (`ecs/components`): for example, `MeshComponent` (geometry data or reference), `MaterialComponent` (shader parameters), and `VisibilityComponent` (for culling or LOD).
* Add ECS **Resources** (`ecs/resources`): track frame statistics, global uniforms (camera position, projection), and any profiling data to be shared across systems.
* Implement ECS **Systems** (`ecs/systems`):

  * **Extraction** system: pull necessary data from game state into render state each frame.
  * **Preparation** system: update uniform buffers, sort objects, and prepare draw calls or compute dispatches.
  * **Queueing** system: send commands to the GPU (populating command buffers with draw or dispatch calls).
  * **Cleanup** system: post-frame tasks such as swapping ping-pong buffers (like `GpuGridTextures.swap()` after compute dispatch) and resetting temporary allocations.

### Asset Pipeline (Shaders, Models, Textures)

* Organize **Shader sources** (`assets/shaders`): create subfolders for common shader code, material shaders, and compute kernels. Write GLSL/WGSL for basic lighting models and ensure they compile without errors.
* Prepare **Material Definitions** (`assets/shaders/materials`): e.g., a simple unlit shader, a PBR shader, and special shaders for debug or visualizing the automata state.
* Include sample **Models** (`assets/models`): basic geometry (cube, sphere, plane) and possibly more complex models to test the renderer. Implement a loader if necessary for a common format (GLTF, OBJ).
* Include **Textures** (`assets/textures`): provide some test HDR environment maps, normal maps, and icon textures (for UI or debugging) to verify texture loading and usage in materials.
* Implement asset management: ensure the engine can load these assets (using Bevy’s asset server or a custom loader) and handle hot-reloading of shaders for iteration.

### Utilities and Configuration

* Integrate **Profiling tools** (`utilities/profiling`): implement GPU timing queries to measure each render pass and compute dispatch. Integrate CPU timing and aggregate metrics for performance analysis each frame.
* Improve **Logging** (`utilities/logging`): use structured logging to trace engine operations. Possibly include a togglable debug UI or console to display logs or engine stats in real time.
* Provide a **Configuration system** (`utilities/config`): manage feature flags (toggles for enabling/disabling GPU compute, switching between forward/deferred, etc.) and load user settings (screen resolution, quality settings) at startup.

### Testing and Validation

* Write **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration`): for example, render a known scene and verify the output (perhaps compare hash or pixel values) to catch regression in the graphics pipelines.
* Develop **Stress Tests** (`tests/benchmarks`): measure frame rate with many objects or heavy effects, ensuring the engine meets performance targets and identifying bottlenecks (e.g., memory bandwidth, draw call count).
* Implement **Diagnostic Tools** (`tests/diagnostics`): use GPU validation layers and error callbacks to verify correct usage of the GPU API. Include shader validation to parse and check all WGSL/GLSL shaders during development (as done with Naga parser in tests).
* Set up continuous integration to run these tests and possibly generate automated reports (frame timings, correctness images) for each build, ensuring a high-quality delivery of the engine.
